### Dashboard Background
I created this interactive report using global powerplant data because I wanted to better understand how geographies differ based on energy sources and generation. This data relies on a collection of data sources ranging from different energy bureaus and organizations. The database includes about 28,500 power plants from 164 countries.

The biggest problem with this dataset is that it does not paint the most accurate picture of global generation. Not all powerplants or countries are included in the dataset as it is difficult to centralize all of that information. Also, there is no electricity generation reported for either China or Russia in any year. For their analysis, the report relies on estimated generation of electricity.
