### Dashboard Background
I created this dashboard using Contoso Sales data to display an executive-level report for insights related to brands, sales channel, region, etc. The goal of this report was to provide a valuable business dashboard and to create a visually appealing one-page report.

Users are able to filter down to Country, Year, and Stores to view sales performance by revenue, cost, and gross profit. As a result of slicing this data, users can view these performance metrics by brands and products. Sales data is only available from 2011 to 2013.

The data consists of over two million rows of sales data related to a fake company called Contoso. It is available in the PowerBI Designer file on the Microsoft website: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46801

## Thank You!
